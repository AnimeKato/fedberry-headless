# Fedberry-headless
Headless mode is a system configuration which enables access to FedBerry (at first boot) using ssh from another computer on a network. When this feature is enabled, the initial-setup service is bypassed and disabled.

## Enable Headless mode
1) After copying Fedberry to your SD card, mount the /boot partition and create a text file called `headless` or `headless.txt` (if using Windows).

2) Unmout your SD card and use it to boot Fedberry in headless mode.
